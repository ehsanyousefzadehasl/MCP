# Near Memory Computing: Past, Present, and Future
[reference](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335028505_Near-Memory_Computing_Past_Present_and_Future)

The reason mentioned in this paper for moving toward these technologies is that conventional way of moving data to the CPU has become a significant performance bottleneck. Processing in the home of the data can significantly diminish the data movement problem at data-intensive applications.

Three dimensional stacking is considered as the true enabler of processing close to the memory. It allows stacking logic and memory together using TSVs (Through-Silicon Vias). Some of these technologies:
- Micron's HMC (Hybrid Memory Cube)
- High bandwidth memory (HBM) of AMD and Hynix
- Samsung's wide I/O

The following figure show the evolution of computing systems through time from left to right.

**NOTE**: Conceptually, the approach of near-memory computing can be applied to any level or type of memory to improve the overall system performance.

There were some work on in-disk computation, but because of its negligible performance imporvement it is not considered serious.
